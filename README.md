# 👋🧩 Mben Morphe Patches

Personal Morphe patch bundle.

## ❓ About

Patches for apps I like — unlocking paid features, stripping ads and telemetry,
and adding a few things the stock apps don't do (local backup, local device sync,
an in-app QR scanner).

## 📱 Supported apps

| App | Package | Verified version | File type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AliExpress | `com.alibaba.aliexpresshd` | 8.162.8 | APKM (split bundle) |
| DeviceInfo | `com.ytheekshana.deviceinfo` | 3.4.4.0 | APK |
| Google Contacts | `com.google.android.contacts` | 4.90.16.998876676 | APK |
| Infinity for Reddit+ | `ml.docilealligator.infinityforreddit.plus` | 8.3.4 | APK |
| Infinity for Reddit (Patreon) | `ml.docilealligator.infinityforreddit.patreon` | 8.3.4 | APK |
| Masareef | `com.appsqueue.masareef` | 2.5.2 | APK |
| MT Capsule | `com.pryshedko.mtisland` | 17.3 (minSdk 32) | APK |
| Salaat First | `org.hicham.salaat` | 6.4.1 | APK |
| Speedtest by Ookla | `org.zwanoo.android.speedtest` | 7.1.2, 7.1.1 | APK |
| StayFree | `com.burockgames.timeclocker` | 20.18.2 | APK |
| Windy | `com.windyty.android` | 51.3.2, 51.2.1, 51.0.1 | APK |

Any app not listed above is **not** supported by this bundle.

A few targets need the right APK:

- **AliExpress** and **StayFree** ship as Play split bundles. Patch the *merged
  universal* APK, never the bare base — StayFree's base alone fails to install on
  Android 14+ with `INSTALL_FAILED_NO_MATCHING_ABIS`. Merge with
  [APKEditor](https://github.com/REAndroid/APKEditor) (`java -jar APKEditor.jar m -i
  app.xapk -o merged.apk`), and make sure the **density** split is included, not only
  the ABI one: 149 of StayFree's drawables live only in `config.xxhdpi`, and a merge
  that drops them installs fine but then crashes with
  `Resources$NotFoundException: Resource ID #0x7f080237` as soon as a screen needs one.
  Online converters are the usual cause.
- **Salaat First** is often passed around as a merged APK that has lost its
  `META-INF/services` files. Without them the online city search (the only one that
  understands Arabic) and the official Moroccan timetable silently fail.
  `Neutralize Signature Check` restores those files, so a merged APK is fine.
- **MT Capsule** accepts versions newer than 17.3 as **experimental** targets. The
  patches are fingerprint based, so they may or may not resolve against a build they
  were not verified on; if one fails to apply, downgrade to 17.3.
- **Infinity for Reddit** is not pinned to a version at all — every anchor resolves
  from a stable literal rather than the version name — but only 8.3.4 is verified.

### Notable patches

The full, always-current list is [further down](#-patches-list) and is generated on
every release. Highlights:

| Patch | App | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unlock Pro | MT Capsule | Unlocks all pro features without a purchase. |
| Unlock all premium features | StayFree | Every theme and custom app icon, without levels, pairing or sign-up. |
| Unlock Premium | Windy | Premium UI and features client-side (server-side data still needs a real subscription). |
| Unlock Ad-Free | Speedtest | Removes ads and unlocks ad-free status. |
| Spoof client (Infinity) | Infinity for Reddit | Swaps in your own Reddit OAuth credentials so the app keeps working. Needs a client ID. |
| Modify login WebView (Infinity) | Infinity for Reddit | Gives Reddit's login page a Chrome user agent and JavaScript so in-app login stops failing (port of Patcheddit's). Enabled by default. |
| Local data backup | StayFree | Export/restore usage history, limits and settings to a local zip — no Google account. |
| Local device sync | StayFree | Pairs with the browser extension over your LAN, so nothing goes to StayFree/SensorTower. |
| In-app QR scanner | StayFree | Scans the extension's pairing QR inside the app, via ZXing (no Play Services). |
| AMOLED dark mode | AliExpress, Masareef, DeviceInfo, Google Contacts | Pure-black backgrounds; on AliExpress it also unblacklists Xiaomi devices, on DeviceInfo and Google Contacts it covers both the default palette and "Use system colors". |
| Remove Donate Screen | DeviceInfo | Removes every entry into the Donate screen (Settings, overflow menu, About) and closes it if anything still opens it. |
| Bypass License Check | Masareef | Stubs the pairip signature/license check that otherwise rejects the re-signed APK. No-op on the verified 2.5.2 target (pairip was added in 2.6.1); kept for later pairip builds. |
| Neutralize Signature Check | Salaat First | Stubs the anti-tamper check that `System.exit(0)`s a re-signed build, and restores the `META-INF/services` files that merge tools strip. Required by every other Salaat patch. Enabled by default. |
| Fix Location Detection on microG | Salaat First | Asks for a quick high-accuracy fix so "locating" no longer hangs for 10 minutes on microG devices. Enabled by default. |
| Add microG support | Google Contacts | Signs in to your Google account through microG instead of Play services, so contacts sync, Phenotype and push work on a de-Googled phone. Enabled by default; needs microG installed, and cannot be used with a root (mount) install. |
| Disable All Telemetry | 6 apps | One switch per app that pulls in that app's full analytics/tracking removal. |

Most telemetry and ad-removal patches ship **disabled by default** — enable the ones
you want in Morphe Manager. Every DeviceInfo patch (including `AMOLED Dark Theme`,
`Hide Privacy Policy Link`, `Hide Remove Ads Button` and `Remove Donate Screen`) is
disabled by default, as is Google Contacts' `AMOLED Dark Theme` (its `Add microG
support` stays enabled).

### ⚠️ Patches that need setup

- **Spoof client (Infinity)** requires an OAuth **client ID** from
  [reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) (create an *installed
  app*). Without it the patch fails rather than shipping stock credentials. The
  **redirect URI** defaults to `redreader://rr_oauth_redir` and the **user agent** to
  `org.quantumbadger.redreader/1.25.1`; the redirect URI must match what you entered on
  Reddit *exactly* or login fails at the callback, so change it there or here until the
  two agree. Blank the user agent to keep the app's own. Both Infinity patches here
  replace Patcheddit's (`Spoof client` and `Modify login WebView`), so leave the
  Patcheddit bundle unselected for Infinity: selecting both makes its patches rewrite
  the same literals and `loadUrl` calls first.
- **Local device sync** (StayFree) needs the patched browser extension on the other
  end; the app serves sync on port `8787`.
- **Add microG support** (Google Contacts) needs **microG** already installed —
  [MicroG-RE](https://github.com/WSTxda/MicroG-RE) or ReVanced GmsCore — and an account
  added inside it. It is **unavailable for root (mount) installs**: a mount install keeps
  stock Contacts' manifest, so microG never learns which app to vouch for. The patch
  spoofs Contacts' rotated signing certificate (`e4cf6254…`, the one Android 13+ reports);
  on an older device the platform uses the original `ee3e2b5d…` key instead and sign-in
  will not be granted.

| [AMOLED Dark Theme](#amoled-dark-theme) | Makes the dark theme pure black: the window, contact lists and cards become #000000, while dialogs and menus stay near-black so they remain visible. Applies to both the default palette and "Use system colors". Turn on dark mode to see it. |  |

Not for root (mount) installs. |  |

<br>

**🎯 Supported versions:**

| 8.162.8 |
| :---: |

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [AMOLED dark mode](#amoled-dark-mode) | Unlocks AliExpress' built-in dark mode on every device (Redmi/Xiaomi/POCO are blacklisted by the app), turns it on by default so the app follows the system theme (it can still be switched off in Settings > Dark mode), and makes dark backgrounds pure black. |  |

| [Disable forced updates](#disable-forced-updates) | Stops the automatic "new version available" and forced update dialogs. |  |
| [Disable promotions notifications](#disable-promotions-notifications) | Drops promotional push notifications (deals, campaigns, wishlist price drops, trends). Order status and message notifications still come through. |  |
| [Disable splash screen](#disable-splash-screen) | Skips the full-screen splash advertisement shown on app launch. |  |

<summary>📦 StayFree&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;20 patches</summary>
<br>

**🎯 Supported versions:**

| 20.18.2 |
| :---: |

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Assume device is online](#assume-device-is-online) | Fixes "Something went wrong, please try again…" when pairing with the browser extension. StayFree gates all sync behind a precheck that must reach Google and that also refuses to sync while usage-data collection is opted out; local pairing is served from the phone itself and needs neither, so report the device as free to sync. |  |
| [Debug QR pairing path](#debug-qr-pairing-path) | Diagnostic only. Records why StayFree's QR pairing does or does not issue its pairing request — the two guards on the scanned code, and the device-group status the pairing coroutine checks before it reaches the network — to the same log as "Local device sync". Leave this off unless you are debugging a pairing failure. |  |
| [Disable All Telemetry](#disable-all-telemetry) | Removes and blocks all telemetry and analytics: SensorTower usage-data upload (app/web usage, browsing, shopping, AI prompts), Amplitude, Singular, Bugsnag, Firebase Analytics/Crashlytics/Performance/Sessions, Google App Measurement, Facebook app events and the advertising ID. Telemetry endpoints are also rewritten to localhost. |  |
| [Fix MIUI permission check crash](#fix-miui-permission-check-crash) | Stops the Xiaomi/Redmi/Poco "background pop-up" permission check from crashing on AOSP-based ROMs ("Bad operation #10021"), which otherwise aborts device pairing with "Something went wrong". |  |
| [Hide Google sign-in in Paired Devices](#hide-google-sign-in-in-paired-devices) | Hides the "Sign in with Google" button from the Paired Devices section in settings. Pairing with a code still works. |  |
| [Hide texts](#hide-texts) | Hides the instruction text on the "Pair with code" screen: "Select the app you want to pair your Android app with:". |  |
| [In-app QR scanner](#in-app-qr-scanner) | Scans the browser extension's pairing QR code inside StayFree, like Brave's built-in scanner, instead of asking you to open the camera app (whose link can't open a patched app). Opens on its own when you choose to pair with a browser extension or the desktop app, and from a "Scan QR code" shortcut on the app icon. Uses ZXing, so it works without Google Play Services. |  |
| [Local data backup](#local-data-backup) | Replaces the Google Drive "Usage Data Backup" in Settings > Storage with a local backup: export your usage history, limits and settings to a zip file you pick, and restore them from one. Needs no Google account and no longer asks you to opt in to data collection. |  |
| [Local device sync](#local-device-sync) | Pairs the phone with the StayFree browser extension over your local network without data collection. The app runs a small sync server on port 8787 and serves its usage straight from Android, so nothing goes to StayFree/SensorTower. Removes the "Anonymous data collection must be enabled to pair devices" prompt. Needs the patched browser extension. |  |
| [Refresh paired devices list](#refresh-paired-devices-list) | Fixes Settings > Paired Devices staying empty after a device pairs successfully. StayFree reloads the device list and announces it on a flow that nothing observes, while the screen waits on a flow that nothing ever updates, so it never recomposes. Announce the reload on the flow the screen actually watches. |  |
| [Remove App Info contents](#remove-app-info-contents) | Keeps the "App Info" row with the version number in Settings, but it no longer opens the App Info screen: Debug Usage Limit Problems, Data Privacy, StayFree Community, Support us, Credits & Open source libraries and the support App ID are gone. They are also removed from the settings search. |  |
| [Remove Follow us](#remove-follow-us) | Removes the "• Follow us!" link next to "StayFree" at the top of the side menu. Tapping the header no longer opens StayFree's social media page. |  |
| [Remove Get Help](#remove-get-help) | Removes the "Get Help" row (HelpScout support chat) from Settings and from the settings search. |  |
| [Remove Google login request](#remove-google-login-request) | Removes the "Sign in with Google" page from onboarding and the "Create StayFree profile" step from the home setup checklist. Signing in manually from the drawer/pairing screens still works. |  |
| [Remove Inbox Control](#remove-inbox-control) | Removes the Inbox Control (Gmail cleaner) feature: its drawer entry, its permissions section and every screen that opens it. The Neon theme and custom app icons that were locked behind signing up for it are unlocked, and the Gmail sign-in no longer keeps the permission setup reminder on the home screen. |  |
| [Remove My Friends](#remove-my-friends) | Removes "My Friends" (usage sharing with friends through StayFree's servers) from the side menu and from the settings search. |  |
| [Remove data collection opt-out](#remove-data-collection-opt-out) | Removes the "Opt-Out of Data Collection" switch from Settings > Data Privacy and locks data collection off: the opt-out can no longer be undone (the "Opt-In" buttons do nothing) and the opt-out status is never reported to StayFree. Includes "Disable All Telemetry". |  |
| [Remove drawer sign-in](#remove-drawer-sign-in) | Removes the "Sign into StayFree" account row from the bottom of the side menu. |  |
| [Remove pair devices banner](#remove-pair-devices-banner) | Removes the "Tap to pair your devices for the best StayFree experience!" banner from the dashboard and the "Cross Platform is here" sheet it opens (Google login on each device, "Share Download Links"). |  |
| [Unlock all premium features](#unlock-all-premium-features) | Unlocks every theme (gamification-level, Black and Neon themes) and all custom app icons without earning levels, pairing a device or signing up for Inbox Control. |  |

<summary>📦 Salaat First&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;7 patches</summary>
<br>

**🎯 Supported versions:**

| 6.4.1 |
| :---: |

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Deactivate Firebase Telemetry](#deactivate-firebase-telemetry) | Disables Firebase/Google Analytics collection, Crashlytics crash reporting and session tracking via manifest flags, strips the App Measurement services and receiver, and removes the advertising-ID permission. App functionality (prayer times, push notifications) is unaffected. |  |
| [Disable All Telemetry](#disable-all-telemetry) | Comprehensive privacy patch: disables the OpenSignal and CellRebel data-collection SDKs and deactivates Firebase/Google Analytics, Crashlytics and session tracking. Does not affect app functionality. |  |
| [Disable App Rating Prompt](#disable-app-rating-prompt) | Removes the Play In-App Review ("rate this app") prompt launched from MainActivity.onCreate, so the review dialog is never requested. |  |
| [Disable Partner Data-Collection SDKs](#disable-partner-data-collection-sdks) | Disables the bundled OpenSignal and CellRebel network-measurement SDKs, which collect location, cell and network telemetry in the background. Forces each wrapper's eligibility check to return false so the SDKs never initialize. Also strips their background components from the manifest. |  |
| [Fix Location Detection on microG](#fix-location-detection-on-microg) | Makes the one-shot current-location request ask for a high-accuracy fix within seconds instead of the hourly balanced-power default. On microG the default never returns a fix, so the setup wizard and "use my location" stay stuck on "locating". No effect on how often the app refreshes location in the background. |  |
| [Ignore Remote-Config Overrides](#ignore-remote-config-overrides) | Severs the Flagsmith remote-override channel by forcing the remote-config delegate to always resolve to the Firebase provider (which uses the app's bundled defaults). Server-side flags can no longer be flipped on against a patched build. Config reads keep working normally. |  |
| [Neutralize Signature Check](#neutralize-signature-check) | Stubs the hidden anti-tamper check in LanguageCheckerKt that MD5-fingerprints the signing certificate and calls System.exit(0) when it does not match the bundled signature. A re-signed (patched) APK always mismatches, so without this the app kills itself on launch and no other patch can run. Also restores the META-INF/services files that APK merge tools strip, without which city search and official timetables fail. Required dependency of every other Salaat patch. |  |

Server-side premium data still requires a real subscription. Note: the map needs WebGL — it stays gray on WebViews that block WebGL (e.g. Cromite SystemWebView). |  |

### 🛠️ Building locally

- Run `./gradlew buildAndroid`
- The built patches .mpp file is found in `patches/build/libs/patches-*.mpp`
- Patch the mpp file using [Morphe-Desktop](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-desktop)
  like any other patch bundle.

To verify a patch actually resolves against a real APK (there is no test suite —
this *is* the test):

```bash
./gradlew :patches:applyToApk --args "<path-to.apk> [outputDexDir] [--patches=<app>]"

Gradle pulls the patcher from GitHub Packages, so a GitHub PAT is required: set
`gpr.user` / `gpr.key` in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`, or `GITHUB_ACTOR` /
`GITHUB_TOKEN` in the environment.

See the [Morphe documentation](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-documentation) for more information.
