/**
 * Removes the paywall nag that Infinity+ shows on launch.
 *
 * `Infinity->y()` opens the subscription activity whenever the "unlocked" flag is false.
 * Returning from it immediately also skips the EventBus broadcast that follows, which is
 * what the subscription screen listens to, so nothing is left half-initialised.
 *
 * `billingClientOnServiceConnected` is resolved leniently: its anchor literal was dropped
 * in 8.3.3, and the paywall is already gone once `y()` is neutered, so a miss is not fatal.
