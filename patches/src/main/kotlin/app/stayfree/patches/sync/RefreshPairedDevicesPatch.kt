        //
        // Settings > Paired Devices (`Lst9;`) reads the list straight out of the static `B0` and
        // feeds it to `DeviceRegistry.deviceGroups-impl(...)`, but wraps that whole computation in
        // a Compose cache keyed on `Lzl2;->h0:Lq87;` — a *different* flow. Across the entire app:
        //
        //   - `T`  is posted to here and read by nothing.
        //   - `h0` is collected by this screen and eight others, and written nowhere but <clinit>.
        //
        // So the device list is reloaded correctly and the screen is simply never told. It
        // composes once against whatever `B0` held when it was first shown — an empty list on a
        // cold start — and keeps showing that. Restarting the app does not help: the reload still
        // lands after the screen's first composition.
        //
        // This is StayFree's own bug, not something local sync introduces. It stayed invisible
        // because until pairing worked the list was genuinely empty; the only way to see it is to
        // pair successfully and then watch the screen fail to notice.
        //
        // Post to `h0` as well as `T` rather than redirecting `T` to `h0`: `T` is dead in this
        // build, but it is a public field and some path not visible here may yet read it, whereas
        // an extra invalidation on `h0` can only ever cost one recomposition of screens that are
        // already recomputing from `B0`. Those eight other screens read device data too, so
        // waking them on a device-list change is correct for them as well.
